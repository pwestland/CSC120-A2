What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

It was important to check that all of the computer's attributes matched up and that none were missing so essentially, putting it all together was more of a struggle than drafting the pieces. I would advise to just double-check all of your methods and names after you've written them to make sure they match.
